CVSS Score: 6.8
CPE id: cpe:/a:gnu:gcc:4.2.1
Published on:             2008-04-06T19:44:00.000-04:00
Summary Description: ** DISPUTED **  gcc 4.2.0 through 4.3.0 in GNU Compiler Collection, when casts are not used, considers the sum of a pointer and an int to be greater than or equal to the pointer, which might lead to removal of length testing code that was intended as a protection mechanism against integer overflow and buffer overflow attacks, and provide no diagnostic message about this removal. NOTE: the vendor has determined that this compiler behavior is correct according to section 6.5.6 of the C99 standard (aka ISO/IEC 9899:1999).

Published on:             2013-04-25T19:55:01.500-04:00
Summary Description: libxml2 2.9.0 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via an XML file containing an entity declaration with long replacement text and many references to this entity, aka "internal entity expansion" with linear complexity.

		*** Potential security defect found in libxml2:2.7.3
CVE: CVE-2010-4008
CVSS Score: 4.3
CPE id: cpe:/a:xmlsoft:libxml2:2.7.3

Summary Description: libxml2 before 2.7.8, as used in Google Chrome before 7.0.517.44, Apple Safari 5.0.2 and earlier, and other products, reads from invalid memory locations during processing of malformed XPath expressions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted XML document.

		*** Potential security defect found in clamav:0.97
CVE: CVE-2013-2020
CVSS Score: 5.0
CPE id: cpe:/a:clamav:clamav:0.97.1
Published on:             2013-05-13T19:55:02.243-04:00
Summary Description: Integer underflow in the cli_scanpe function in pe.c in ClamAV before 0.97.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a skewed offset larger than the size of the PE section in a UPX packed executable, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.

		*** Potential security defect found in clamav:0.97
CVE: CVE-2011-2721
CVSS Score: 5.0
CPE id: cpe:/a:clamav:clamav:0.97
Published on:             2011-08-05T17:55:08.843-04:00
Summary Description: Off-by-one error in the cli_hm_scan function in matcher-hash.c in libclamav in ClamAV before 0.97.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via an e-mail message that is not properly handled during certain hash calculations.

		*** Potential security defect found in clamav:0.97
CVE: CVE-2013-2021
CVSS Score: 4.3

Summary Description: pdf.c in ClamAV 0.97.1 through 0.97.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds-read) via a crafted length value in an encrypted PDF file.

		*** Potential security defect found in clamav:0.97
CVE: CVE-2011-3627
CVSS Score: 4.3

Summary Description: The bytecode engine in ClamAV before 0.97.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors related to "recursion level" and (1) libclamav/bytecode.c and (2) libclamav/bytecode_api.c.

		*** Potential security defect found in nano:2.0.6
CVE: CVE-2010-1161

Published on:             2010-04-16T15:30:00.493-04:00
Summary Description: Race condition in GNU nano before 2.2.4, when run by root to edit a file that is not owned by root, allows local user-assisted attackers to change the ownership of arbitrary files via vectors related to the creation of backup files.

		*** Potential security defect found in nano:2.0.6
CVE: CVE-2010-1160
CVSS Score: 1.9
CPE id: cpe:/a:gnu:nano:2.0.6
Published on:             2010-04-16T15:30:00.460-04:00
Summary Description: GNU nano before 2.2.4 does not verify whether a file has been changed before it is overwritten in a file-save operation, which allows local user-assisted attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on an attacker-owned file that is being edited by the victim.

		*** Potential security defect found in net-snmp:5.6
CVE: CVE-2014-2284
