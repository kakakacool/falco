    o CRITCAL - If the vfeed.db does not exist, the empty database file is created

    o CRITICAL - README and other documentation is lacking, need to 
    explain dependencies, install, use case, limitations , see:
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304863/how-to-write-a-good-readme
    
    o SERIOUS - No install utility or instructions

    o SERIOUS - CPE matching is a simple match into the database.  PyPy has a fullimplementation of CPE implemented, which should be the best choice for CPE matches. However, name/version seems to be working for simple cases.

    o CPE matching takes name:version strings in -n
    
    o for single test, does not announce what is being tested
    
    o the database version out is not useful, need to report what 
    the last update was for the database
    
    o need a database update feature in falco, don't depend on vfeed cli
    
    o refactoring needs:
        variable names, long lines, indentation
        pylint is our friend
