    o SERIOUS - No install utility or instructions

    o SERIOUS - the testlist.txt file in the test directory is not 
processed correctly.  It appears that the apache and oscar entries
are not checked. To reproduce the bug:
cd test; ../falco -d ../vfeed.db -f testlist.txt 
    o SERIOUS - CPE matching is a simple match into the database.  PyPy has a fullimplementation of CPE implemented, which should be the best choice for CPE matches. However, name/version seems to be working for simple cases.

    o for single test, does not announce what is being tested
    
    o the database version out is not useful, need to report what 
    the last update was for the database
    
    o need a database update feature in falco, don't depend on vfeed cli
    
    o refactoring needs:
        variable names, long lines, indentation
        pylint is our friend
