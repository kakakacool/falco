    o CRITCAL - If the vfeed.db does not exist, the file is created
    o CRITCAL - CPE matching for -v is not working well:
        ../falco -d ../vfeed.db -n postgresql -v 8.5 <- does not exist,
        matches on v8.4
    o CPE matching takes name:version strings in -n
    o for single test, does not announce what is being tested
    o the database version out is not useful, need to report what 
    the last update was for the database
    o need a database update feature in falco, don't depend on vfeed cli
    o refactoring needs:
        variable names, long lines, indentation
        pylint is our friend
